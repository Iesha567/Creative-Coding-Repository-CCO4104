## Reflection

This experiment explores how the mouse can affect a group of shapes on the screen. The starting point for this work was simple p5.js tutorials that show how to use the mouse position, distance, and basic movement.

The sketch uses a grid of points stored in an array. In each frame, the distance between the mouse and each point is checked. When the mouse is close, the points move.

In version 1, the points move away from the mouse,  repelling it. In version 2, the movement direction is reversed so the points move toward the mouse,  attracting it. In version 3, the movement becomes stronger when the mouse button is pressed.

I tested different spacing values and movement strengths to make sure the interaction was clear and easy to understand. I kept the visuals simple so I could focus on learning how mouse interaction works in p5.js.

This experiment helped me understand how small changes to the code can create different interactive behaviours using the same basic structure.
