## Reflection
This experiment explores different visual representations of a real time clock using p5.js.  
My starting point was basic online tutorials and examples demonstrating the use of p5.js time functions such as hour(), minute() and second().

The sketches uses simple shapes and mapping techniques to translate time into visual elements. Version 1 maps time to the size of circles, version 2 uses horizontal bars, and version 3 explores rotating lines. These varieties allow me to experiment with how the same data can be represented in different visual forms.

During development, I focused on keeping the code simple and readable while experimenting with small changes to layout and animation. This helped me understand how time-based functions and mapping affect visual behaviour in real time.

If I had more time, I would explore smoother transitions and more complex visual styles as mine were quite basic . Overall, this experiment helped me gain confidence working with time-based data and creative coding techniques in p5.js.
