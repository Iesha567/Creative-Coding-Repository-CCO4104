## Reflection

This experiment explores an animated text display where text appears gradually over time. The starting point for this work was simple p5.js tutorials that show how to display text and use timing with frameCount.

The sketch displays a short piece of text on the screen and reveals it one character at a time. This is done by increasing an index value and using substring() to control how much of the text is shown. This creates a simple typewriter-style effect.

In version 1, the text is revealed at a steady speed. In version 2 a subtle background fade is added to create a softer visual effect. In version 3, the speed of the text reveal is changed to explore how timing affects the reading experience. These small changes helped me understand how animation and timing can change how text is perceived.

I kept the code and visuals simple so I could focus on learning how text, timing, and animation work together in p5.js. This experiment helped me understand how progressive text display can be created using basic creative coding techniques.
